                    We took over The Lounge in February 2020 – a month before
                    the pandemic and were forced to go into lockdown, not the
                    best timing, but we are still here and going strong
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Through lockdown with all the imposed restrictions we were
                    the first establishment in Redditch to open for takeaway
                    cocktails keeping everyone happy and hydrated; from locals
                    to those passing through on their way home from work.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    The Lounge is a small Gin & Cocktail Bar situated on Evesham
                    Road in Astwood Bank that can seat up to 32 cocktail lovers
                    inside with a small seating area at the front for 8 people.

                  Taking over a Coffee Shop during the second lockdown in November 2020 may not have been the best idea but we did it anyway and haven’t looked back!
                  We are now an award winning establishment after being nominated for, and winning Best Café in Warwickshire,
                  Best Café in the Midlands and then Best Café in England in 2021.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  During lockdown and restrictions we were able to keep customers warm and caffeinated with takeaway coffees,
                  cakes and food, and took that time to develop the outside area and decorate.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  You’ll find us situated on the High Street in Alcester in a quirky Grade II
                  listed building that can seat up to 30 inside, 8 outside on the high street and up to 40 in what
                  we like to call our secret garden.
